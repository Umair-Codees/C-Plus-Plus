# C-Plus-Plus DSA: Linked List
Welcome to the C-Plus-Plus DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) repository! This section focuses specifically on # Linked Lists. Here you will find detailed implementations of various types of linked lists, along with their algorithms, explanations, and time complexities.

# Folder Structure:
C-Plus-Plus/DSA/Linked-List/: Contains all implementations related to Linked Lists in C++.
Singly Linked List: Implementation of singly linked list and its operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Doubly Linked List: Code for doubly linked list and related operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Circular Linked List: Implementation of circular linked list with code for insertions and deletions.
Algorithms: Common linked list algorithms like reversing the list, detecting cycles, and merging sorted lists.
# Topics Covered in This Section:
1. Singly Linked List
Basic Operations: Insertion (at head, tail, and middle), deletion (by position or value), traversal, and search.
Time Complexity: Analysis of each operation.
Use Cases: When to use singly linked lists over other data structures.
2. Doubly Linked List
Basic Operations: Insertion and deletion at both ends (head and tail), traversal in both directions, and reverse traversal.
Benefits of Doubly Linked List: Easy deletion from both ends.
3. Circular Linked List
Concepts: How circular linked lists work, insertion and deletion in a circular linked list, and usage.
Circular Singly and Doubly Linked Lists: Differences, implementation, and when to use.
4. Common Linked List Algorithms
Reversal of Linked List: Implement and understand how to reverse a linked list.
Detecting Loops: Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm.
Merging Two Sorted Lists: Combine two sorted linked lists into one sorted list.
Finding Middle Node: Algorithm to find the middle element of a linked list.
5. Additional Features
Linked List Sorting: Sorting a linked list using Merge Sort or Insertion Sort.
Intersection of Two Linked Lists: How to find the intersection point of two linked lists.
Why Linked Lists?
Linked lists are foundational data structures used in a variety of applications. Understanding them thoroughly is essential for:

Solving algorithmic problems efficiently.
Preparing for coding interviews.
Working with low-level memory management in languages like C++.

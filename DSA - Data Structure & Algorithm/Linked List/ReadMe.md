# C-Plus-Plus DSA: Linked List
Welcome to the C-Plus-Plus DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) repository! This section focuses specifically on Linked Lists. Here you will find detailed implementations of various types of linked lists, along with their algorithms, explanations, and time complexities.

# Topics Covered in This Section:
## 1. Singly Linked List
Basic Operations: Insertion (at head, tail, and middle), deletion (by position or value), traversal, and search.  
Time Complexity: Analysis of each operation.  
Use Cases: When to use singly linked lists over other data structures.  
## 2. Doubly Linked List
Basic Operations: Insertion and deletion at both ends (head and tail), traversal in both directions, and reverse traversal.  
Benefits of Doubly Linked List: Easy deletion from both ends.  
## 3. Circular Linked List
Concepts: How circular linked lists work, insertion and deletion in a circular linked list, and usage.  
Circular Singly and Doubly Linked Lists: Differences, implementation, and when to use.  
## 4. Common Linked List Algorithms
Reversal of Linked List: Implement and understand how to reverse a linked list.  
Detecting Loops: Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm.  
Merging Two Sorted Lists: Combine two sorted linked lists into one sorted list.  
Finding Middle Node: Algorithm to find the middle element of a linked list.  
## 5. Additional Features
Linked List Sorting: Sorting a linked list using Merge Sort or Insertion Sort.  
Intersection of Two Linked Lists: How to find the intersection point of two linked lists.  

# Why Linked Lists?
Linked lists are foundational data structures used in a variety of applications. Understanding them thoroughly is essential for:  
Solving algorithmic problems efficiently.  
Preparing for coding interviews.  
Working with low-level memory management in languages like C++.

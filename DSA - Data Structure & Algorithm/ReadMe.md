# C-Plus-Plus DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)
Welcome to the C-Plus-Plus DSA repository! This project is a comprehensive collection of essential data structures and algorithms implemented in C++. The goal of this repository is to provide easy-to-follow code examples for learners, interviewees, and developers to strengthen their knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms.

#  Topics Covered in This Repository:
1. Linked List:
Singly Linked List: Learn how to implement a simple singly linked list and operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Doubly Linked List: Explore doubly linked lists with bidirectional traversal, insertion, and deletion from both ends.
Circular Linked List: Understand circular linked lists and their applications in problems like round-robin scheduling and memory management.
2. Stack:
Stack Basics: Learn the stack data structure and how to implement its basic operations such as push, pop, and peek.
Applications of Stack: Solve problems like balanced parentheses, infix to postfix conversion, and evaluating expressions using stacks.
3. Queue:
Queue Basics: Understand the queue data structure and implement its basic operations (enqueue, dequeue, front).
Circular Queue and Priority Queue: Explore specialized versions of queues like circular queues and priority queues (heap-based).
4. Trees:
Binary Tree: Explore tree traversal techniques (in-order, pre-order, post-order) and learn how to implement basic binary tree operations.
Binary Search Tree (BST): Learn about searching, insertion, and deletion operations in BSTs.
AVL Trees and Red-Black Trees: Learn about self-balancing trees and their importance in maintaining efficient performance.
Heap (Min and Max): Understand heaps and their application in sorting and priority queues.
5. Sorting:
Bubble Sort: Implement the simple but inefficient bubble sort algorithm.
Merge Sort: Implement the divide-and-conquer approach to sorting.
Quick Sort: Learn the fast, recursive sorting technique based on pivot elements.
Insertion Sort, Selection Sort: Explore other simpler sorting algorithms and their time complexities.
6. Searching:
Linear Search: Basic searching algorithm that checks each element one by one.
Binary Search: Efficient searching algorithm for sorted arrays (O(log n) time complexity).
Jump Search: A hybrid search algorithm that improves linear search by jumping ahead in steps.
7. Graphs:
Graph Representation: Learn how to represent graphs using adjacency matrices and lists.
Breadth-First Search (BFS): Implement BFS to explore graphs level by level.
Depth-First Search (DFS): Understand DFS and use it to solve problems like finding connected components.
Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm: Shortest path algorithm for weighted graphs.
8. Recursion:
Learn fundamental recursive problem-solving techniques and practice solving problems using recursion.
9. Dynamic Programming (DP):
Solve optimization problems using dynamic programming. Learn famous DP problems like Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, and Fibonacci series.
# Why DSA in C++?
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are the backbone of efficient computing and are essential in solving problems in coding interviews, competitions, and real-world applications. C++ is chosen because of its rich library and ability to work closely with memory, making it ideal for understanding how data is stored and manipulated.

# C-Plus-Plus Repository
Welcome to the C-Plus-Plus repository! This repository contains various C++ projects and solutions categorized into key areas: ITC (Introduction to C++), PF (Problem Solving), OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), and DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms). Each section is designed to help learners, developers, and interviewees build their C++ programming skills step-by-step.

# Topics Covered in This Repository:
## 1. ITC (Introduction to C++):
Basic C++ Syntax: Understanding the basic syntax, data types, operators, loops, and conditionals.  
Functions: Learn about functions, function overloading, recursion, and more.  
Input/Output: Understanding the basics of reading from and writing to the console and files.  
Arrays and Strings: Working with arrays and basic string manipulations.  
Control Structures: Master if-else, switch-case, loops, and how they work in C++.  
## 2. PF (Programming fundamentals):
Practice Problems: A collection of problems designed to strengthen problem-solving skills.  
Mathematical Problems: Solving problems related to number theory, prime numbers, factorials, etc.  
Pattern Problems: Pattern generation problems (triangle, pyramid, etc.).  
Array & String Manipulation: Includes basic array traversal, searching, sorting, and string manipulation challenges.  
Recursive Solutions: Problems solved using recursion for better understanding.  
## 3. OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):
Classes & Objects: Learn the fundamentals of creating classes, objects, constructors, and destructors in C++.  
Encapsulation: Understanding data hiding, access modifiers, and member functions.  
Inheritance: Implementing inheritance to reuse code, create subclasses, and extend classes.  
Polymorphism: Learn about function overloading, operator overloading, and virtual functions for runtime polymorphism.  
Abstraction: Implementing abstract classes and interfaces in C++.  
Projects: Real-life projects demonstrating OOP principles (e.g., a banking system or student management system).  
## 4. DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms):
Sorting Algorithms: Implementing popular sorting algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort, InsertionSort, and more.  
Searching Algorithms: Learn efficient search algorithms such as Binary Search, Linear Search, and Jump Search.  
Linked List: Implement Singly Linked Lists, Doubly Linked Lists, and Circular Linked Lists with basic operations.  
Stack & Queue: Learn about Stacks, Queues, and their applications in real-world problems like expression evaluation and job scheduling.  
Trees: Master the basics of Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), and advanced trees like AVL Trees and Red-Black Trees.  
Dynamic Programming: Solve optimization problems with dynamic programming approaches like Knapsack, Fibonacci, Longest Common Subsequence.  
Graph Algorithms: Learn about graph traversal using DFS, BFS, and shortest-path algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s.  
# Why C++?
C++ is one of the most widely-used programming languages, known for its powerful features like manual memory management, low-level system programming, and high-performance computing. Understanding C++ will provide you with a strong foundation to build scalable applications, solve complex algorithms, and design real-world systems.
